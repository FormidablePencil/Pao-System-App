# Pao System

A mnemonic device for memorizing long strands of digits.

## What is the pao system?

The Pao system is a mnemonic device to allow one to memorizing long digits of numbers in a short amount of time. The idea is to convert digits into memorable images and arrange those images in a so called "memory palace." 

Once the Pao system is learned one can potentially memorize hundreds of digits at a time and this technique can be used in a similar manner to memorize absolutely anything like another language or terminology which otherwise would be difficult and boring. Watch a tutorial of this mnemonic device [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-gCm3gEFQE&feature=youtu.be&t=27).

## Purpose

To learning such a system requires one to refer back to it every so often and putting it to practice to imprint it in the memory. The Pao System app serves as a catalog and has a study mode to aid one in memorizing the system.
